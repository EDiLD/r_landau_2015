## Preliminaries

### Install R

If you don't already have set up R on your laptop, please download and install it from [here](http://cran.rstudio.com/). 
You can use the code editor of your choice. However, I recommend using [RStudio Desktop](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).


### Installing packages

Packages extend the basic functionality of R, add functions or datasets.
For this course we need a few extra packages.  Please install the following packages - simply paste and run this command in your R prompt :

```{R}
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "plyr", "blmeco", "ggmap"), 
                 dependencies = TRUE)
```


### Downloading code and data
