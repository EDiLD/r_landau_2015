    ##  $ laptop: chr  "yes" "yes" "no" "yes" ...

From the `affl` column, we see that the Uni-Landau was entered in different ways. Lets create a new column coding if the attendee comes from Landau.

We can use columns `email` and `affl` to check if an attendee come form landau. We use [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) to match the word 'landau' in both columns. Note, that I compare only lowercase strings, as this saves 2 comparisons.

Character vectors can be translated to lowercase using `tolower()`:

``` r
tolower(df$affl)
```

    ##  [1] "uni landau"                     "uni landau"                    
    ##  [3] "universitÃ¤t koblenz-landau "    "university koblenz landau"     
    ##  [5] ""                               "wassercluster lunz"            
    ##  [7] "csic"                           "uni landau"                    
    ##  [9] "university of basel"            "uni landau, molecular ecology "
    ## [11] "uni landau"

We can check if a string contains `'landau'` using the function `grepl()` (= global regular expression, l stands for logical which is the output):

``` r
grepl(pattern = 'landau', df$email)
```

    ##  [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE

I a last step we combine both using the logical `OR` and save as new variable:

``` r
df$fromlandau <- grepl(pattern = 'landau', df$email) | grepl(pattern = 'landau', tolower(df$affl))
```

Plot the data

### How many attendies replied and where are they from?

We have only 11 repsonses:

``` r
nrow(df)
```

    ## [1] 11

from which the majority

``` r
sum(df$fromlandau)
```

    ## [1] 8

are from Landau.

``` r
require(ggplot2)
require(RColorBrewer)
classPalette = colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(5, "Dark2"))
```

``` r
nlev <- length(unique(df$fromlandau))
ggplot(df, aes(x = factor(1), fill = df$fromlandau)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = classPalette(nlev)) +
  guides(fill= guide_legend(reverse=TRUE, title = 'from Landau?'))
```

![](questionnaire_files/figure-markdown_github/plot_fromlandau-1.png)

### What room do we need?

Note that we need a computer room, as two attendees won't bring their laptop. Or we provide laptops?!

``` r
nlev <- length(unique(df$laptop))
ggplot(df, aes(x = factor(1), fill = df$laptop)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = classPalette(nlev)) +
  guides(fill= guide_legend(reverse=TRUE, title = 'bring laptop?'))
```

![](questionnaire_files/figure-markdown_github/plot_laptop-1.png)

``` r
sum(df$laptop == 'no') / nrow(df) * 100
```

    ## [1] 18.18182

### What's the backgound knowledge?

``` r
nlev <- length(unique(df$prog))
ggplot(df, aes(x = factor(1), fill = prog)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = classPalette(nlev)) +
  ggtitle('Programming')
```

![](questionnaire_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

``` r
nlev <- length(unique(df$theory))
ggplot(df, aes(x = factor(1), fill = abbreviate(theory))) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = classPalette(nlev)) +
  ggtitle('Theory')
```

![](questionnaire_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

``` r
nlev <- length(unique(df$rknow))
ggplot(df, aes(x = factor(1), fill = abbreviate(rknow))) +
  geom_bar() +
  ggtitle('R knowledge') +
  facet_wrap(~fromlandau)
```

![](questionnaire_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)

``` r
nlev <- length(unique(df$curr))
ggplot(df, aes(x = factor(1), fill = abbreviate(curr))) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = classPalette(nlev)) +
  ggtitle('Software usage') +
  facet_wrap(~fromlandau)
```

![](questionnaire_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)

-   Generally wide spread R knowledge and usage!
-   One attendee without any R knowledge (T.S. from Landau) (Check if its fine if we don't start with the very basics?!)
-   From outside: One who's not using R (!), others are beginners or intermediate.

### What is needed?

``` r
nlev <- length(unique(df$inter))
ggplot(df, aes(x = factor(1), fill = abbreviate(inter))) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = classPalette(nlev)) +
  ggtitle('Software usage') +
  facet_wrap(~fromlandau)
```

![](questionnaire_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)

``` r
